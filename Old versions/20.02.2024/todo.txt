where to place cd functions...I think should also be in the child so have no effect - but it seems to be working...

1. cat doesn't exit properly with ctrlc...double minishell>
using global variable so far isn't helping - it's value seems to reset
2. error messages
3. builtins - unset and export (all others done - echo and pwd seem to work with execve, so I'm wondering if they really
need something special) 
4. ls | pwd is waiting like cat | cat | ls and shouldn't be
similary cat filename | grep ft
5. malloc with cd when go all the way back
