SOLVED?/Improve

there must be a neater way of solving the simple commands issue

where to place cd functions...I think should also be in the child so have no effect - but it seems to be working...
now everything is inside the child and working better

1. cat doesn't exit properly with ctrlc...double minishell> [SOLVED??]
using global variable so far isn't helping - it's value seems to reset

ls | pwd is waiting like cat | cat | ls and shouldn't be

temporary solution to put the execution function within its own process
although this solves the problem, cat | cat | ls no longer works...and ctrlc is even more annoying than before

4.related problem - cat filename | grep ft - the grep prints with the minishell> commandline, but it should happen after this
this seems to be a huge problem and realted to processes and waiting
I can solve this by swapping the order of the parent and child process in pipes.c, but this ruins cat | cat | ls and related commands
changing the location of the wait also seems to affect - but suspect that fd not being closed properly - look at original code for inspiration
clearly pipes need to be revisited 
SOLVED - just needed to wait for the whole pipe execution (not just within that)

//problem with malloc and unset
//grep and env not working - we seem to print env and not grep the results
----------------------------------

LEFT
2. error messages
3. builtins - export, exit (all others done - echo and pwd seem to work with execve, so I'm wondering if they really
need something special)
5. malloc with cd when go all the way back
6. the temporary heredoc appears if an 'ls' is used later in the command line - need to change this - tried unlinking before an ls call, but this is a problem
is ls appears in a longer command line e.g. cat << here | grep e | ls | cat << here | grep U, should only do it if ls is going to be displayed i.e. the final element
7. relatedly, heredoc followed by a simple command ends in a wait that not expecting unless it is used with cat...
8. env | ls | cat - we seem to be waiting for cat to finish like with cat | cat | ls - we shouldn't be
