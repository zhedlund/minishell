3. CTRL-\:

- wc -l - new problem - any other options like this

notes	- (if the only arguement is) cat, wc, grep with one arguement - Quit coredumped - exit code - 131
	- (if the initial arguement is) cat, wc, grep with one arguement (and further arguements are differnt e.g. builtins) - ^\ - exit code 0
	- if with redirections different
	- ...
	
cat, wc, grep ft, wc -l (any others?)
any combination of the above

any of the above with simple commands - solo cat should also be updated

and of the above with redirections

CTRL-\:

- Try ctrl-\ after running a blocking command like cat without arguments or grep “something“:

minishell> cat
^\Quit (core dumped)
minishell> echo $?
131            // FIXED exit code
minishell> grep "hey"
^\minishell>          <<< wrong, should be ^\Quit (core dumped) on new line
131          // FIXED exit code
minishell>

Bash:

zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ grep "hey"
^\Quit (core dumped)
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?
131
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ cat
^\Quit (core dumped)
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?

4. - Try ctrl-C after running a blocking command like cat  without arguments or grep “something“:
	
	
minishell> cat
^C
minishell> echo $?
0                        <<< wrong, should be 130
minishell> grep "hey"
^C
minishell> echo $?
127                     <<< wrong, should be 130
minishell> 	

Bash:			

zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ cat
^C
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?
130
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ grep "hey"
^C
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?
