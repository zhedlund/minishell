EVAL CHECK 

- command with only space gives segmenation fault

- Set the $PATH to a multiple directory value (directory1:directory2)
	and ensure that directories are checked in order from left to right.
	- I have no idea how to test this?

- heredoc: doesn't work when no space after <<":
	minishell> <<end
	minishell: syntax error near '<<'
	
	shouldn't print heredoc, just >, but not really an error
	
- export: doesn't work with quotes:
	minishell> export "this=that"
	input === export
	Minishell: export: '"this=that"':  not a valid identifier
	Exit code: 0 should be 1(?)
	
	export shouldn't print anything. not an error, just reminder to remove debug statement
	
- unset: 
	doesn't work with quotes:
	unset "this" gives no output
	no error message
	exit code: 0, should be 1(?)
	
	unset shouldn't print anything when successful. not an error, just reminder to remove debug statement
	
- cd:	wrong error msg + exit code:
	minishell> cd nonexistingdir
	chdir: No such file or directory
	expected:
	minishell: cd: nonexistingdir : No such file or directory
	exit code should be 1
	
- exit: ls | exit
	exit code: 13, should be 0

- echo / quotes:
	minishell> echo ""abc""
	output: abc""
	expected: abc
	error in ft_echo or in parser?
	
	minishell> echo -n -n -nnnn -nnnnm
	-n -nnnn -nnnnmminishell>
	should be: -nnnnmminishell>
	
	history gets messed up after echo -n, but seems to behave similar to bash

- Ctrl+D: if used to exit, gives exit code 130, should be 0
	exit code 0 after blocking cmd (correct)

- Ctrl+C: if used after blocking cmd like cat:
	  exit code: 2, should be 130
	  if used on empty line:
	  exit code: 0, should be 130
	  
- quotes: minishell> echo "hello '''" / echo 'hello """'
	unmatched quote
	should be: hello ''' / hello """

- "" 	should print "Error", exit(127)
	now prints nothing, exit 0
	
-  gets stuck, need to press enter once (doesn't happen in bash):
	env | grep OLDPWD
	pwd | cat

- behave like in bash:
	cat | pwd (need to press enter once)
	cat | ls  (eturns table, need to press enter once)
	cat | cat | ls (need to press enter 3 times) 
	ls | cat (returns a list, not table)
