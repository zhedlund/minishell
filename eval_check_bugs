EVAL CHECK 

- Set the $PATH to a multiple directory value (directory1:directory2)
	and ensure that directories are checked in order from left to right.
	- I have no idea how to test this?

- heredoc: doesn't work when no space after <<":
	minishell> <<end
	minishell: syntax error near '<<'
	
	shouldn't print heredoc, just >, but not really an error
	
- unset: 
	- no error message
	- exit code: 0, should be 1(?)
	
- cd:	wrong error msg + exit code:
	minishell> cd nonexistingdir
	chdir: No such file or directory
	expected:
	minishell: cd: nonexistingdir : No such file or directory
	exit code should be 1? 
	
- exit: ls | exit
	exit code: 13, should be 0
	
	minishell> echo -n -n -nnnn -nnnnm
	-n -nnnn -nnnnmminishell>
	should be: -nnnnmminishell>

- Ctrl+D: if used to exit, gives exit code 130, should be 0
	exit code 0 after blocking cmd (correct)

- Ctrl+C: if used after blocking cmd like cat:
	  exit code: 2, should be 130
	  if used on empty line:
	  exit code: 0, should be 130
	  
- echo / quotes:
	minishell> echo ""abc""
	output: abc""
	expected: abc
	error in ft_echo or in parser?
	  
- quotes: minishell> echo "hello '''" / echo 'hello """'
	unmatched quote
	should be: hello ''' / hello """

- "" 	should print "Error", exit(127)
	now prints nothing, exit 0
	
- command with only space:
	- in bash commands works even with leading whitespace, we should check full line
