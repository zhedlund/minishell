EVAL CHECK 

No refactoring if not absolutely necessary! Go through checklist first.


CD
Valgrind error with cd command

ENV: 
	it now prints the full line from env,
	it should only print the variable, not the label:
	
	minishell> echo "hello $USER, this is your home: $HOME"
	output: hello USER=zhedlund, this is your home: HOME=/home/zhedlund
	expected: hello zhedlund, this is your home: /home/zhedlund


CTRL+C:

- ctrl-C in a prompt after you wrote some stuff should display a new line with a new prompt.

minishell> echo hey^C
minishell> echo $?
0                   <<< wrong, should be 130

bash:
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo hey^C
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?
130

- Try ctrl-C after running a blocking command like cat  without arguments or grep “something“:
	
	
minishell> cat
^C
minishell> echo $?
131                    <<< wrong, should be 130
minishell> grep something
^C
minishell> echo $?
131                    <<< wrong, should be 130

Bash:			

zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ cat
^C
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?
130
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ grep "hey"
^C
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?
130



CTRL-\:

- Try ctrl-\ after running a blocking command like cat without arguments or grep “something“:

works with cat and wc, not grep.

minishell> grep "hey"
^\minishell>          <<< wrong, should be ^\Quit (core dumped) on new line
