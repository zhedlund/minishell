No refactoring if not absolutely necessary! Go through checklist and norminette_list first.


1. FUNCTIONS WITH TOO MANY PARAMETERS:

	handle_env_var

2. EXPORT
	some undefined behaviours:
	
	- Doesn't work with numbers in var before =, but works with number in new var:
	
	minishell> export hhh3=hhh
	Minishell: export: 'hhh3=hhh':  not a valid identifier
	minishell> export aaa=bbb3
	minishell> echo $aaa
	bbb3
	
	- the error still gives exit code 0
	
	bash works with numbers, as long as it's not the first character:

	zhedlund@c4c4c1:~$ export 666="lol"
	bash: export: `666=lol': not a valid identifier
	zhedlund@c4c4c1:~$ export h666="lol"
	zhedlund@c4c4c1:~$ export h666=lol
	zhedlund@c4c4c1:~$ echo $h666
	lol


	
	- doesn't work with space in new variable (not sure it makes sense with space in env var, but works in bash):

	minishell> export aaa="bbb ccc"
	minishell> echo $aaa
	bbb
	


3. HEREDOC
	expansions not working with cat:
	(I changed the promt to imitate bash)
	
	minishell> cat << hh
	> $USER
	> hh
	$USER
	
	bash:
	zhedlund@c4c4c1:~$ cat << hh
	> $USER
	> hh
	zhedlund


4. ENV PATH
	I still don't know how to test this in a simple way:
	
	"Set the $PATH to a multiple directory value (directory1:directory2) and ensure that directories are checked in order from left to right."
	
	
5. NORMINETTE
