No refactoring if not absolutely necessary! Go through checklist and norminette_list first.


FIXED. 0. ADD WERROR FLAG IN MAKEFILE

FIXED. 1. Input empty string doesn't give error (wrong):

minishell> ""
minishell> echo $?
0

Should print "Error" (printed from perror in ft_execvp, so probably from changes in handle_exec_cmd)
It was like this before (correct):

minishell> ""
just gives new line, error code 0
should print "Error", error code 127

minishell> .
free(): double free detected in tcache 2


2. CD
valgrind error with cd command:

ERROR SUMMARY: 63 errors from 17 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0

sometimes it gives this error, but not every time
minishell> cd parsing/
free(): invalid pointer
zsh: IOT instruction (core dumped)  ./minishell


3. ENV: 
	minishell> echo "hello $USER, this is your home: $HOME"
	output: hello USER=zhedlund, this is your home: HOME=/home/zhedlund
	expected: hello zhedlund, this is your home: /home/zhedlund

4. SIGNALS:
Enter on empty line gives segfault

minishell> 
zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./minishell

5. CTRL+C:

- ctrl-C in a prompt after you wrote some stuff should display a new line with a new prompt.

minishell> echo hey^C
minishell> echo $?
0                   <<< wrong, should be 130

bash for reference:
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo hey^C
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?
130

6.
- Try ctrl-C after running a blocking command like cat  without arguments or grep “something“:
	
minishell> cat
^C
minishell> echo $?
131                    <<< wrong, should be 130
minishell> grep "something"
^C
minishell> echo $?
131                    <<< wrong, should be 130

Bash for reference:			

zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ cat
^C
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?
130
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ grep "something"
^C
zhedlund@c4b10c2:~$ echo $?
130


7. CTRL-\:

- Try ctrl-\ after running a blocking command like cat without arguments or grep “something“:

works with cat and wc, not grep.

minishell> grep "something"
^\minishell>          <<< wrong, should be ^\Quit (core dumped) on new line


8. FUNCTIONS WITH TOO MANY PARAMETERS:

handle_env_var
parse_tokens

9. EXPORT

export without args prints the list, but segfaults
